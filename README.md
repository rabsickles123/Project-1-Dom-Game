# Project-1-Dom-Game
This was my first project from my training at Per Scholas. It utilizes HTML, CSS and Javascript
and the game runs dynamically through Javascript DOM manipulation. I feel like this game fully utilized all the knowledge I have learned from all three technologies barring objects and classes.

## The Game
A straightforward rock, paper, scissors game with seven rounds (an odd number seemed appropriate to give less chances of a draw). The game starts once the player decides to press a button.

#### Method
Planning out the game was the most important aspect and thus there is a pseudocode.txt file outlining all the thoughts regarding HOW to actually make the game. This was perhaps the most difficult/overwhelming part of everything. I understood the basics of what was needed in each file and that was typed out and organized by file in the pseudocode. This included things that were nice to have (in terms of animation and styling that couldve been tedious and thus left as "nice to have" once the functionality was viable). Most of the focus was in the scripting and DOM manipulation although, towards the end, the audio files were added to the HTML file instead of using the Audio constructor.
