-each button will trigger 
-a huge if else statement that will look at the various conditions and calculate a win
each round of a game can consist of 7 games with player1 and player2/computer having 
have an array or counter of player1 and player2/computer and have them store the wins 
and not appoint a point if there is no win
   - will need a condition that checks for a tie and does NOT give a point to either party
     and still continues the game.
   - determines when game is over and states winner or declares tie/draw
- need functions (!!!)
